Before 2d game project:
	Sound engine
		Sound manager - like texure manager
		soundId = PlaySound(sound, stereo, volume, pitch);  // pich is 440 normative
		soundId = PlaySoundLoop(sound, stereo, volume, pitch);  // looping sound
		stopSound(soundId);
		stopAllSound(Sound);
		changeSound(soundId, stereo, volume, pitch)
		changeSoundTo(soundId, stereo, volume, pitch, time) // change all sound data over time
	More 2d layouting stuff
		text that fits in a box	



3D Object class that takes care of object loading and management instead of having individual raw VAO
	move individual primitive generation to their own files

Resource manager for
	3d Objects
	Nodes
	2d Graphs


Start reorganizing image loading


Other stuff
	expand color class to include color conversion
		Investigate srgb and adobeRGB

	Start splitting vectormath and glz into multiple files and give each class its own file



To improve:
	State manager
	frambuffer
