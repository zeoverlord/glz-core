// while it is not required i like to request a few things
// 1. please do share any meaningfull/usefull changes/additions/fixes you make with me so that i could include it in any future version
// 2. likewise do share any ideas for improvements
// 3. If you make something comersiol or at least something you release publicly that relies on this code then i would like to know and maybe use in my CV
// 4. Please do include me in your credits

// global z-tool app data
// visit http://www.flashbang.se or contact me at overlord@flashbang.se
// the entire toolkit should exist in it's entirety at github
